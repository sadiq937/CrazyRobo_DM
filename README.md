# Shaik Mohammed Sadiq-DataManagement 

A repository dedicated to exploring data management techniques using Python and Pandas for the Rutgers course **2025SP - Data Management (56:219:522:40) by FNU SHAIK MOHAMMED SADIQ, GRADUATE STUDENT IN DATA SCIENCE**

## Repository Overview

This Repository focuses on practical applications of Python for data manipulation and analysis. Through problem sets and projects, and deal with essential skills such as:

- Data cleaning, reshaping, and merging.
- Utilizing libraries like Pandas for advanced operations.
- Automating data workflows and visualizations.

## Dataset: CRM + Sales + Opportunities Analysis
This repository uses the **CRM + Sales + Opportunities Analysis**, sourced from Kaggle. This dataset was chosen for its complexity and real-world relevance, making it ideal for demonstrating advanced data management techniques.
---
### Why This Dataset?
#### Real-World Complexity:
- The dataset includes multiple interconnected tables (e.g., accounts, sales pipelines, products, and sales teams), mimicking real-world business scenarios.
- It provides an opportunity to work with diverse data formats (HTML, CSV, JSON, XML, Parquet) and perform data integration.

#### Data Management Challenges:
- **Merging and Mapping**: Combining data from different sources (e.g., accounts and sales pipelines) to create a unified view.
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyzing sales trends, revenue, and performance metrics.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

#### Visualization Opportunities:
- The dataset allows for the creation of insightful visualizations to explore relationships, such as:
  - Sales performance by agent.
  - Revenue distribution by sector.
  - Trends in deal stages (e.g., won, lost, in progress).
---
## Dataset Files
The dataset is loaded in the following formats:
- **accounts.html**: Contains account information (e.g., company name, sector, revenue).
- **sales_pipeline.csv**: Contains sales opportunity data (e.g., opportunity ID, sales agent, deal stage, close value).
- **sales_teams.json**: Contains sales team details (e.g., sales agent, manager, regional office).
- **products.xml**: Contains product information (e.g., product name, category).
- **data_dictionary.parquet**: Contains metadata and descriptions of the dataset fields.
---
## Tools and Frameworks
The following tools and frameworks are used in this repository:
- **Python 3.10+**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Colab**: For collaborative notebook editing and running Python code in the cloud.
- **GitHub**: For version control and repository management.
